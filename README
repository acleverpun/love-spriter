id/references Note:
This parser is adding 1 to all id/parent/etc values and references because of Lua 1 based tables
From looking at the data, I am assuming that the ID in the data is a 1:1 mapping to C-style 0-indexed arrays
The re-mapping is not 100% necessary, but in Lua it is a LOT easier for things to be 1-based.  It is not worth it to maintain 0-indexed arrays

usage:
local Spriter = require("libs/Spriter")
--Animation filename assumed to be animationDirectory/animationDirectory.scon
local spriterData = Spriter:loadSpriter("./", "animationDirectory")

Note: loadSpriter is primary entry point to class.
